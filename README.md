`White Space` is the simplest was to communicate socially in distance

---

White Space lets you display text in a very large font directly from your smart phones.

Which comes handy when you needs to display text to someone else staying at a distance.

Rendering happens locally on your phone and your text is not transmitted to any servers. How cool!

White Space was originally developed to communicate something to someone else at a distance at the time of Covid-19 pandemic.
