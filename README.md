`White Space` is the simplest was to communicate socially in distance

---

White Space lets you display text in a  large font directly from your smartphones.

White Space comes in handy when you need to display text to someone else staying at a distance.

Rendering happens locally on your phone therefore your text is never to any servers. How cool!


White Space was originally developed to communicate something to someone else at a distance in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.
